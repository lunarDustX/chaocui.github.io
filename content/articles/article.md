### AR Pop-up Toy

AR technology is a bridge between virtual and reality.<br>
With the help of AR glasses, it's possible to see something fantasy.

The basic idea of this project is super simple: use a **tangible object** as a trigger, to make something happen in the virtual world.

#### Araddin Lamp

The first idea came into my mind is Araddin Magic Lamp, the famous folk tale in the book One Thousand and One Nights. The genie will appear when you touch/rub the tangible lamp.

#### Pokemon Ball

Another idea is the Pokemon Ball. At the beginning of Pokemon games, players should choose one of the three Pokemons. In this case, Pokemon will appear when you open the Pokemon Ball, and disappear when you close the ball.

With the help of AR glasses, we could see something we believe exists in the world.

#### Prayer
A possible fantasy experience is that, gods will gradually appear when you heat a cross sensor by your hands(body temperature).

#### Harry Potter
It's also possible to make the "Guardian Spell" in Harry Potter come true. Different people could see different animals depends on different wand movement?
