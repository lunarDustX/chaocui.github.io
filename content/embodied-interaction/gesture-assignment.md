### Core Gesture
At first, we found the "opening pinched fingers" gesture looks like the process of bloom, it would be natural to use this gesture to plant a flower. We decided to create a gardening experience based on this gesture.

<!-- chose the "opening pinched fingers" gesture as the primary interaction of this project, because the gesture looks like the process of bloom, it's natural to use this gesture to plant a flower. -->

### Interface
Then, we designed a simple interface for users to select, scale, and create flowers. The "select" and "scale" gestures are two common gestures in widely used in other projects. We chose them as complementary gestures to enhance the gardening experience.

### Experience
Here is a demo of how the idea can be used in a 2D space. It's not difficult to imagine this idea can be developed further into a more immersive 3D space experience. 

<!-- we also implemented a simple interface for users to select, scale, and create flowers. -->

<!-- ### AR Pop-up Toy

AR technology is a bridge between virtual and reality.<br>
With the help of AR glasses, it's possible to see something fantasy.

The basic idea of this project is super simple: use a **tangible object** as a trigger, to make something happen in the virtual world.

#### Araddin Lamp

The first idea came into my mind is Araddin Magic Lamp, the famous folk tale in the book One Thousand and One Nights. The genie will appear when you touch/rub the tangible lamp.

#### Pokemon Ball

Another idea is the Pokemon Ball. At the beginning of Pokemon games, players should choose one of the three Pokemons. In this case, Pokemon will appear when you open the Pokemon Ball, and disappear when you close the ball.

With the help of AR glasses, we could see something we believe exists in the world.

#### Prayer
A possible fantasy experience is that, gods will gradually appear when you heat a cross sensor by your hands(body temperature).

#### Harry Potter
It's also possible to make the "Guardian Spell" in Harry Potter come true. Different people could see different animals depends on different wand movement?
